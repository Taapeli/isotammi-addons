Gramplet to fix invalid Event date formats (formats that Gramps cannot parse) via selectable Search and Replace. That Gramplet can only be added to the Events category.

Rationale:
Some genealogical tools use formats that are non-standard or ambiguous. This gramplet allows transforming imported Event dates into formats that Gramps can understand. The transforms are applied to the selected rows in the Events category view. The "Events with an invalid date" custom filter rule will limit row to those with non-conformant dates.
